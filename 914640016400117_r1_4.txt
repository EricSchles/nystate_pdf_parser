Description:
This permit modification consolidates three applications, including one (1) significant permit
modification and two (2) minor permit modifications as follows:

REN1 MOD4 – Significant Modification:
This project is for the removal of the continuous emission monitors (CEM) for sulfur dioxide
(SO2) and carbonyl sulfide (COS) located in the Main Stack (Emission Point (EP) U-NCS01).
In addition, the SO2 CEM located at the RTO stack (EP SEPAR) will be removed. Permit
requirements for SO2 and COS CEM’s have been removed. The Main Stack SO2 CEM has not
been relevant since 2005 when the wet air oxidation (WAO) process began operating in place of
the B2 process/scrubber that generated high SO2 emissions. The CEMs for COS and SO2 are
not required by NYSDEC or USEPA regulations.

Compliance with emission capping and other permit requirements will be determined using
emission factors for SO2 and COS derived from stack test data and RATA reports. To
demonstrate compliance with the 28.43 lb SO2/hr limit for EP SEPAR, 3M will continuously
monitor the pH of the liquor leaving the separator as a surrogate for SO2 emissions. The pH of

this liquor directly affects the WAO process. It is critical to maintain the pH of the solution
above a level of 2.3 to minimize the volatilization of reducible sulfur compounds, which are
subsequently oxidized to SO2 by the RTO and exhausted through EP SEPAR.

REN1 MOD3 – Minor Modification:
This project consisted of the installation of a dust collector, Emission Source Control (ESC)
C0084 to control particulate emissions from Emission Point MC001. A redundant dust
collector (ESC C0085), that may or may not be installed in the future, was also added to the
permit. ESC C0084 and ESC C0085 are both associated with Process MCO and are contained in
Emission Unit U-MAKOT. A decision to install the redundant system, which includes Emission
Source 00085 and EP MC002 (both added to permit in REN 1 MOD 2, but never installed), will
be made at a later date. However, 3M has requested that this system be left in the permit to
avoid any delays (permit) should they decide to install the second system. Particulate emissions
will not increase as a result of this project.

REN1 MOD5 – Minor Modification:
This project is for the installation of two (2) new blenders for viscose production (aging). Each
blender will be vented to the facility's existing Solvent Recovery Unit (SRU). In addition, 3M
requested the removal of the Bun Coagulation Tanks, Emission Source 00030 from the Title V
permit, which were physically dismantled in January 2011.




By acceptance of this permit, the permittee agrees that the permit is contingent upon strict
compliance with the ECL, all applicable regulations, the General Conditions specified and any
Special Conditions included as part of this permit.

        NOTIFICATION OF GENERAL PERMITTEE OBLIGATIONS
    The items listed below are not subject to the annual compliance certification
    requirements under Title V. Permittees may also have other obligations
                          under regulations of general applicability.

Item A:     Emergency Defense - 6 NYCRR 201-1.5

            An emergency constitutes an affirmative defense to an
            action brought for noncompliance with emissions
            limitations or permit conditions for all facilities in New
            York State.

            (a) The affirmative defense of emergency shall be
            demonstrated through properly signed, contemporaneous
            operating logs, or other relevant evidence that:

                           (1) An emergency occurred and that the facility owner
            and/or
              operator can identify the cause(s) of the
            emergency;
                           (2) The equipment at the permitted facility causing the
             emergency was at the time being properly operated;
                           (3) During the period of the emergency the facility owner
            and/or operator took all reasonable steps to minimize
            levels of emissions that exceeded the emission standards,
            or other requirements in the permit; and
                           (4) The facility owner and/or operator notified the
            Department
             within two working days after the event occurred. This
            notice must contain a description of the emergency, any
            steps taken to mitigate emissions, and corrective actions
            taken.

            (b) In any enforcement proceeding, the facility owner
            and/or operator seeking to establish the occurrence of an
            emergency has the burden of proof.

            (c) This provision is in addition to any emergency or
            upset provision contained in any applicable requirement.

Item B:     Public Access to Recordkeeping for Title V Facilities - 6
            NYCRR 201-1.10 (b)

Item C:     Timely Application for the Renewal of Title V Permits - 6
            NYCRR 201-6.3 (a) (4)
            Owners and/or operators of facilities having an issued
            Title V permit shall submit a complete application at
            least 180 days, but not more than eighteen months, prior
            to the date of permit expiration for permit renewal
            purposes.

Item D:     Certification by a Responsible Official - 6 NYCRR 201-6.3
            (d) (12)
            Any application, form, report or compliance certification
            required to be submitted pursuant to the federally
            enforceable portions of this permit shall contain a
            certification of truth, accuracy and completeness by a
            responsible official. This certification shall state that
            based on information and belief formed after reasonable
            inquiry, the statements and information in the document
            are true, accurate, and complete.

Item E:     Requirement to Comply With All Conditions - 6 NYCRR
            201-6.5 (a) (2)
            The permittee must comply with all conditions of the
            Title V facility permit. Any permit non-compliance
            constitutes a violation of the Act and is grounds for
            enforcement action; for permit termination, revocation and
            reissuance, or modification; or for denial of a permit
            renewal application.

Item F:     Permit Revocation, Modification, Reopening, Reissuance or
            Termination, and Associated Information Submission
            Requirements - 6 NYCRR 201-6.5 (a) (3)
            This permit may be modified, revoked, reopened and
            reissued, or terminated for cause. The filing of a request
            by the permittee for a permit modification, revocation and
            reissuance, or termination, or of a notification of
            planned changes or anticipated noncompliance does not stay
            any permit condition.

Item G:     Cessation or Reduction of Permitted Activity Not a
            Defense - 6 NYCRR 201-6.5 (a) (5)
            It shall not be a defense for a permittee in an
            enforcement action to claim that a cessation or reduction
            in the permitted activity would have been necessary in
            order to maintain compliance with the conditions of this
            permit.

Item H:     Property Rights - 6 NYCRR 201-6.5 (a) (6)

            This permit does not convey any property rights of any
            sort or any exclusive privilege.

Item I:     Severability - 6 NYCRR 201-6.5 (a) (9)

            If any provisions, parts or conditions of this permit are
            found to be invalid or are the subject of a challenge, the
            remainder of this permit shall continue to be valid.

Item J:     Permit Shield - 6 NYCRR 201-6.5 (g)

            All permittees granted a Title V facility permit shall be
            covered under the protection of a permit shield, except as
            provided under 6 NYCRR Subpart 201-6. Compliance with the
            conditions of the permit shall be deemed compliance with
            any applicable requirements as of the date of permit
            issuance, provided that such applicable requirements are
            included and are specifically identified in the permit, or
            the Department, in acting on the permit application or
            revision, determines in writing that other requirements
            specifically identified are not applicable to the major
            stationary source, and the permit includes the
            determination or a concise summary thereof. Nothing herein
            shall preclude the Department from revising or revoking
            the permit pursuant to 6 NYCRR Part 621 or from exercising
            its summary abatement authority. Nothing in this permit
            shall alter or affect the following:

            i. The ability of the Department to seek to bring suit
            on behalf of the State of New York, or the Administrator
            to seek to bring suit on behalf of the United States, to
            immediately restrain any person causing or contributing to
            pollution presenting an imminent and substantial
            endangerment to public health, welfare or the environment
            to stop the emission of air pollutants causing or
            contributing to such pollution;

            ii. The liability of a permittee of the Title V
            facility for any violation of applicable requirements
            prior to or at the time of permit issuance;

            iii. The applicable requirements of Title IV of the
            Act;

            iv. The ability of the Department or the Administrator
            to obtain information from the permittee concerning the
            ability to enter, inspect and monitor the facility.

Item K:     Reopening for Cause - 6 NYCRR 201-6.5 (i)

            This Title V permit shall be reopened and revised under
            any of the following circumstances:

            i. If additional applicable requirements under the Act
            become applicable where this permit's remaining term is

            three or more years, a reopening shall be completed not
            later than 18 months after promulgation of the applicable
            requirement. No such reopening is required if the
            effective date of the requirement is later than the date
            on which this permit is due to expire, unless the original
            permit or any of its terms and conditions has been
            extended by the Department pursuant to the provisions of
            Part 201-6.7 and Part 621.

            ii. The Department or the Administrator determines
            that the permit contains a material mistake or that
            inaccurate statements were made in establishing the
            emissions standards or other terms or conditions of the
            permit.

            iii. The Department or the Administrator determines
            that the Title V permit must be revised or reopened to
            assure compliance with applicable requirements.

            iv. If the permitted facility is an "affected source"
            subject to the requirements of Title IV of the Act, and
            additional requirements (including excess emissions
            requirements) become applicable. Upon approval by the
            Administrator, excess emissions offset plans shall be
            deemed to be incorporated into the permit.

             Proceedings to reopen and issue Title V facility permits
            shall follow the same procedures as apply to initial
            permit issuance but shall affect only those parts of the
            permit for which cause to reopen exists.

             Reopenings shall not be initiated before a notice of such
            intent is provided to the facility by the Department at
            least thirty days in advance of the date that the permit
            is to be reopened, except that the Department may provide
            a shorter time period in the case of an emergency.

Item L:     Permit Exclusion - ECL 19-0305
            The issuance of this permit by the Department and the
            receipt thereof by the Applicant does not and shall not be
            construed as barring, diminishing, adjudicating or in any
            way affecting any legal, administrative or equitable
            rights or claims, actions, suits, causes of action or
            demands whatsoever that the Department may have against
            the Applicant for violations based on facts and
            circumstances alleged to have occurred or existed prior to
            the effective date of this permit, including, but not
            limited to, any enforcement action authorized pursuant to
            the provisions of applicable federal law, the
            Environmental Conservation Law of the State of New York
            (ECL) and Chapter III of the Official Compilation of the

               provisions designed to limit a facility's potential to
               emit, are enforceable by the Administrator and citizens
               under the Act. The Department has, in this permit,
               specifically designated any terms and conditions that are
               not required under the Act or under any of its applicable
               requirements as being enforceable under only state

                            Submit reports of any required monitoring at a minimum
            frequency of every 6 months, based on a calendar year
            reporting schedule. These reports shall be submitted to

            incidences of noncompliance stating the probable cause of
            such deviations, and any corrective actions or preventive
            measures taken. Where the underlying applicable
            requirement contains a definition of prompt or otherwise
            specifies a time frame for reporting deviations, that
            definition or time frame shall govern. Where the
            underlying applicable requirement fails to address the
            time frame for reporting deviations, reports of deviations
            shall be submitted to the permitting authority based on
            the following schedule:

                           (1) For emissions of a hazardous air pollutant (as
            identified in an applicable regulation) that continue for
            more than an hour in excess of permit requirements, the

            excluding those listed in paragraph (1) of this section,
            that continue for more than two hours in excess of permit
            requirements, the report must be made within 48
            hours.

                           (3) For all other deviations from permit requirements,
            the report shall be contained in the 6 month monitoring
            report required above.

                           (4) This permit may contain a more stringent reporting
            requirement than required by paragraphs (1), (2) or (3)
            above. If more stringent reporting requirements have been
            placed in this permit or exist in applicable requirements
            that apply to this facility, the more stringent reporting
            requirement shall apply.

                            If above paragraphs (1) or (2) are met, the source must

            otherwise limited by regulation. In order to have a
            violation of a federal regulation (such as a new source
            performance standard or national emissions standard for
            hazardous air pollutants) excused, the specific federal

            regulatory agency" the permittee shall include in the
            semiannual report, a statement for each such condition
            that the monitoring or recordkeeping was performed as
            required or requested and a listing of all instances of
            deviations from these requirements.

                          In the case of any emission testing performed during the
            previous six month reporting period, either due to a
            request by the Department, EPA, or a regulatory
            requirement, the permittee shall include in the semiannual
            report a summary of the testing results and shall indicate
            whether or not the Department or EPA has approved the
            results.

                           All semiannual reports shall be submitted to the
            Administrator (or his or her representative) as well as
            two copies to the Department (one copy to the regional air

              sulfur compound (i.e.CS2) cause analyzer interference have
              made it technologically infeasible to obtain accurate
              emission data. The CEM for H2S is not specifically
              required by regulation and therefore can be removed and
              compliance demonstrated by other means. The emissions have
              been tested on a number of occasions and an emission
              factor established from these tests will be used to
              determine compliance with the 33.12 tpy cap based on a
              rolling 12 month average. H2S emissions from the main
              stack, NCS01, were measured at 0.01 pounds per hour during
              sampling in January of 2003. H2S from sources venting to
              the SRU are removed in the preadsorber using a potassium
              iodide impregnated carbon. Maintenance of this preadsorber
              and monitoring of breakthrough will used to insure
              compliance with the H2S limits.

              The significant sources of H2S emissions are from Emission
              unit SEPAR, NCS01 and other sources venting to the SRU.
              The Wet Air Oxidation (WAO) process emissions are
              controlled by a thermal oxidizer. The emission factor for

Monitoring Description:
             The facility has a "cap" for Carbon Disulfide emissions
             of 337.9 tpy. This limit was established under 6 NYCRR
             part 231-2 for the addition of the continuous sponge line,
             permit issued 1/10/2000. Emission point NCS01 vents
             emissions from the solvent recovery unit,USEPAR and
             several uncontrolled sources which are counted against
             this "cap". The 337.9 tpy cap was based on 1997 and 1998
             VOC average emission rate of 358.6 tpy plus 39.9 tpy
             (deminimus) =398.5tpy multiplied by the 94.15% CS2 factor
             to get 337.9 tpy CS2 allowable. (CS2 being the surrogate
             contaminant monitored by CEM). Emissions from NCS01 are
             monitored by CEM. The emission factor for calculating wet
             air oxidation emissions shall be based on the emission
             factor derived from the latest stack test.

Item 43.2:
Compliance Certification shall include the following monitoring:

Monitoring Type: RECORD KEEPING/MAINTENANCE PROCEDURES
Monitoring Description:
             This section of the rule requires facilities using a
             carbon absorber for control to monitor carbon bed
             regeneration frequency, stream mass, volumetric flow,
             temperature etc. in order to insure that the parameters
             are within those established during the performance test.
             Since this facility maintains and operates a Continuous
             Emission Rate Monitoring System (CERMS) for carbon
             disulfide emissions at the inlet and the outlet of the
             carbon absorber the performance of the the equipment is
             considered accurately monitored. Therefore, monitoring of
             the parameters as mentioned in 40 cfr 63.5505(b), table 2,
             number 7 is not required.
             Substituting a CERMS system in lieu of monitoring carbon
             bed regeneration parameters is not clearly stated as being
             allowed in this rule but makes sense. We have confirmed
             with the EPA project lead on this MACT standard and they
             are in agreement with this determination.

              Maintenance of The CERMS as required elsewhere in this
              permit will be considered compliance with this condition.

             2002 for capture efficiency and carbon disulfide
             emissions, the predominant VOC. The NCS sources emit less
             than 3.0 pounds per hour and are exempt from RACT under 6
             NYCRR part 212.10. Compliance with this requirement is met
             by maintaining production data to demonstrate that all

             also occur periodically, which will coincide with one of
             the preadsorber changes. During planned SRU bypass, the
             facility production rate will be reduced to a level which
             produces 140 pounds per hour or less of CS2 emissions out

Item 46.2:
Compliance Certification shall include the following monitoring:

Monitoring Type: CONTINUOUS EMISSION MONITORING (CEM)
Monitoring Description:
             Part 212.10 requires RACT (Reasonable Available Control
             Technology) for major sources of VOC (Volatile Organic
             Compounds). Part 212.10(c)(4)(i) defines RACT for VOC
             emission points which are equipped with a capture and
             control device with an overall removal efficiency to be at
             least 81 %.

               A CEM for Carbon Disulfide is also maintained at the
              inlet and outlet of the SRU for the purpose for
              determining removal efficiency for VOC's. The CEM data
              collected for Carbon Disulfide in conjunction with a 92.3%
              capture efficiency demonstrated during the July 30, 2002
              stack testing (modified based on 2006 operating sources)
              will be used to calculate a weighted average overall
              control efficiency for VOC emissions from the SRU.

              All new or modified emission units operating at the
              facility containing an emission source with a VOC emission
              rate potential greater than 3.0 pounds per hour will be
              required to meet the 81% overall VOC removal
              efficiency.

Item 4-8.2:
Compliance Certification shall include the following monitoring:

Monitoring Type: CONTINUOUS EMISSION MONITORING (CEM)
Monitoring Description:
             The referenced rule requires that the outlet
             concentration of Volatile Organic Compounds (VOC) be
             monitored from fixed bed carbon adsorption units. This
             emission unit is also monitored to determine compliance
             with 6 NYCRR part 212.10 "RACT" by demonstrating an
             overall VOC emission reduction of 81% and to determine
             compliance with the pound/hour and ton/year limits under
             part 231-2. To do this 3M operates and maintains a Carbon
             Disulfide (CS2) Continuous Emission Rate Monitoring System
             which consists of infrared monitors for CS2 at the inlet
             of the carbon adsorption system, the outlet of the carbon
             adsorption system and the main stack with flowmeters at
             the SRU outlet and main stack. This condition outlines
             the operation and oversight of all the CEM systems
             mentioned to determine compliance.

              1.             The continuous emission monitors must be operated at
              all times when the associated process equipment is
              operating except during reasonable periods of monitor
              downtime due to the following causes which are not
              considered deviations:
                             a. Quality assurance, including RATA's and CGA's, daily
              zero and span drift checks and calibration checks;
                             b. Routine maintenance activities;
                             c. Sudden monitor breakdowns due to, among other things,
              power failures;
                             d. Damage to the monitoring system due to acts of God
              such as lightning strikes, tornadoes or floods, which
              render the monitor inoperative.

              2.             Each monitor must be operated according to a quality
              assurance program approved by the Department. Both plans
              must be kept current with update when significant changes
              to the continuous emissions monitoring system or new data
              warrants it. NYSDEC's Air Guide 34 contains an appropriate
              outline for an acceptable Monitoring plan and Quality
              Assurance plan.
              3.             3M must conduct annual RATA testing. 3M will give
              NYSDEC 30 days notice prior to annual RATA tests. A test
              report for RATA's must be submitted to the DEC Region 9
              office and to the Bureau of Compliance Monitoring and
              Enforcement, Albany Central office within 60 days after
              completion of testing.

              4.            The facility shall submit a written report to the

            Region 9 office and to the Bureau of Compliance Monitoring
            and Enforcement, Albany Central Office on a calendar year
            quarter. All quarterly reports shall be post marked by the
            30th day following the end of each calendar quarter and
            shall include:
                            a. A summary of all emission limitations
                            b. A summary of CEM operations, including down time and
            out-of-control periods. The time monitors are taken off
            line for daily zero and span checks need not be reported.
            The data lost because of daily drift checks (two fifteen
            minute periods per day) is not considered as down
            time.
                            c. The Quality Assurance program requires daily,
            quarterly and annual audits. The daily drift checks shall
            be done using a zero level (0 to 20% of span) and high
            level (80 to 100% of span) gas. The CS2 gases must be
            certified NIST traceable gases to + or- 2%. If the
            monitor has dual ranges, and the low range has been
            exceeded for one hour or longer since the previous test,
            both ranges must be tested. The signal calibration check
            for flow meters must be done once per day. A RATA shall be
            done annually. A Cylinder Gas Audit (CGA) shall be done
            quarterly. The CS2 gas must be certified NIST traceable
            to + or- 2%. A RATA can be used in lieu of a CGA for one
            of the quarters. If an audit shows unacceptable results,
            corrective action shall be taken and the audit repeated.
            The results of all audits shall be submitted to the
            department quarterly.
                            d. A summary sheet for the total number of times the
            facility was in violation of the permitted emission
            limits. The total time during the quarter for which the
            CEM system was not recording data including:
                           (i) acceptable monitor downtime
            (defined above, excluding daily zero and span checks,
            which need not be reported);
                           (ii) monitor downtime due to
            circumstances other than those indicated above. Emissions
            for periods where the CEM's do not record data will be
            based on the average emission during the period (CFR 40
            5560(c)).

Monitoring Type: INTERMITTENT EMISSION TESTING
Monitoring Description:
             The mother liquor wash table emissions are proposed to
             increase due to a change in equipment which allows greater
             throughput. This source previously emitted 2.8 lbs/hr of
             VOC emissions, and will be permitted to emit 5.0 pounds
             per hour without control. A Reasonable Available Control
             technology (RACT)evaluation, per air guide 20, was
             submitted with the application and a variance is granted
             upon approval of this permit. Previous stack test data
             along with production records as well as any other
             credible information will be used to track emissions from
             this source. Records must be kept on a monthly basis of
             sponge block throughput and estimated emissions. Stack
             testing may be required at the Departments discretion.


              A RACT analysis is required once every 5 years and for
              consistency with other permit conditions, is required to

             short and long term guidance concentrations established in
             Air Guide 1 as determined by modeling at the property
             line. Air Quality modeling results submitted with the

             Acetaldehyde when controlled by the Thermal Oxidizer
             venting out emission point SEPAR and when in by pass mode
             venting out emission point NCS01. At the estimated
             Potential to Emit and a 98% destruction Efficiency rating
             of the Thermal Oxidizer emissions of Acrolein and
             Acetaldehyde will meet the levels established in Air Guide
             1. During events defined as start up, shutdown , or
             malfunction (SSM) in the facility's SSM plan, or in other
             unexpected emergency situations where it is safer and/or

Monitoring Type: MONITORING OF PROCESS OR CONTROL
                  DEVICE PARAMETERS AS SURROGATE
Monitoring Description:
             Sulfur Dioxide (SO2) emissions at the facility are
             limited to 94.24 tpy under 40 CFR Part 52.21 Subpart A as
             detailed in this permit in a monitoring condition under
             6NYCRR 201-7. Monthly emissions of SO2 from the Thermal
             Oxidizer (TO) will be calculated and counted towards this
             CAP. Although the TO will create SO2 while destroying
             Carbon Disulfide (CS2), as well as other volatile organic
             compounds and hazardous air pollutants, it is the
             Department's opinion that the benefits greatly outweigh
             any other option and therefore control of SO2 is not
             required.

            The outlet pH level for the WAO separator will be measured
            as a surrogate to demonstrate compliance with the 28.43
            lb/hr SO2 emission limit. The pH lower limit of 2.3 pH
            units is based on stack test data, pilot test data and
            operational knowledge. This level will maintain worst case
            process CS2 emissions below 16.88 lb/hr. The resulting SO2
            emissions from Emission Point SEPAR, generated by the
            oxidation of CS2 to SO2 in the TO, will result in
            emissions less than 28.43 lb SO2/hr, based on a 1-hr
            average.

            To verify compliance with the pH lower limit, the outlet
            pH shall be continuously monitored and recorded. The
            continuous recorder shall be installed, operated,
            calibrated and maintained in accordance with the
            manufacturer’s recommendations. All electronic data shall
            be stored securely and backed up on a daily basis.

            The facility shall follow start-up and malfunction
            procedures to achieve the pH limit within 6 hours of
            start- up.

            Original electronic data from the recorder showing
            continuous monitoring and recording of the pH, records of
            calibration, maintenance, repair, start-up, malfunction,
            etc. shall be maintained onsite for five years and shall

                   Replaces Condition(s) 54
Item 4-10.1:
At the discretion of the commissioner a violation of any applicable emission standard for
necessary scheduled equipment maintenance, start-up/shutdown conditions and malfunctions or
upsets may be excused if such violations are unavoidable. The following actions and
recordkeeping and reporting requirements must be adhered to in such circumstances.

(a)            The facility owner and/or operator shall compile and maintain records of all
equipment maintenance or start-up/shutdown activities when they can be expected to result in an
exceedance of any applicable emission standard, and shall submit a report of such activities to
the commissioner's representative when requested to do so in writing or when so required by a
condition of a permit issued for the corresponding air contamination source except where
conditions elsewhere in this permit which contain more stringent reporting and notification
provisions for an applicable requirement, in which case they supercede those stated here. Such
reports shall describe why the violation was unavoidable and shall include the time, frequency
and duration of the maintenance and/or start-up/shutdown activities and the identification of air
contaminants, and the estimated emission rates. If a facility owner and/or operator is subject to
continuous stack monitoring and quarterly reporting requirements, he need not submit reports for
equipment maintenance or start-up/shutdown for the facility to the commissioner's
representative.

(b)            In the event that emissions of air contaminants in excess of any emission standard
in 6 NYCRR Chapter III Subchapter A occur due to a malfunction, the facility owner and/or
operator shall report such malfunction by telephone to the commissioner's representative as soon
as possible during normal working hours, but in any event not later than two working days after
becoming aware that the malfunction occurred. Within 30 days thereafter, when requested in

writing by the commissioner's representative, the facility owner and/or operator shall submit a
written report to the commissioner's representative describing the malfunction, the corrective
action taken, identification of air contaminants, and an estimate of the emission rates. These
reporting requirements are superceded by conditions elsewhere in this permit which contain
reporting and notification provisions for applicable requirements more stringent than those
above.

(c)           The Department may also require the owner and/or operator to include in reports
described under (a) and (b) above an estimate of the maximum ground level concentration of
each air contaminant emitted and the effect of such emissions depending on the deviation of the
malfunction and the air contaminants emitted.

(d)            In the event of maintenance, start-up/shutdown or malfunction conditions which
result in emissions exceeding any applicable emission standard, the facility owner and/or
operator shall take appropriate action to prevent emissions which will result in contravention of
any applicable ambient air quality standard. Reasonably available control technology, as
determined by the commissioner, shall be applied during any maintenance, start-up/shutdown or
malfunction condition subject to this paragraph.

(e)    In order to have a violation of a federal regulation (such as a new source performance
standard or national emissions standard for hazardous air pollutants) excused, the specific
federal regulation must provide for an affirmative defense during start-up, shutdowns,
malfunctions or upsets.

Condition 4-11:       Visible Emissions Limited

Item 56.2:
Compliance Demonstration shall include the following monitoring:

Monitoring Type: INTERMITTENT EMISSION TESTING
Monitoring Description:
             This regulation prohibits any person to allow an emission
             into the outdoor atmosphere of particulates in excess of
             0.20 pounds per million BTU from any oil fired stationary
             combustion installation. This regulation is enforceable by
             New York State and has been proposed in the state's
             implementation plan to replace 6 NYCRR part 227.1b which
             limits particulate emissions to 0.10 lb/mmbtu. Conditions
             for 6NYCRR part 227.1b is also listed in this permit.
             Until the latest version of 227-1 is approved the lower
             limit will be enforced. A once per permit term stack test,
             or within 180 days after first use of oil during the
             permit term,on one of the identical boilers, must be
             performed while firing #2 oil to demonstrate compliance
             with the 227-1 limits in this permit. A protocol must be
             submitted 45 days prior to the proposed test and a report
             of results submitted within 45 days after the test.
